# NLP - Neural-Machine-Translation

In this NLP project, I worked on Neural Machine Translation techniques. I experimented with Sequence to sequence models using multi layer RNN Encoders and Decoders such as LSTM, GRU, BI-RNN, Multi Head Attention and CNN on French-English corpus. The Perplexity and BLEU scores were estimated for each model.
